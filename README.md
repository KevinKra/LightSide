# LightSide

Built in React, LightSide is an application that uses the StarWars API (SWAPI) to present information related to the famous people, noteworthy planets, and popular vehicles, of the StarWars universe. As a user you have the ability to seamlessly sift through the data and favorite those cards that interest you and built up a collection that can be modified as you find other elements of the universe that you are fond of.
